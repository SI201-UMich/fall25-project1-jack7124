These are the results of the penguin calculations in coding_work.py
First Jackson calculated average body mass for each species:
Average Body Mass by Species: {'Adelie': 3700.662251655629, 'Gentoo': 5076.016260162602, 'Chinstrap': 3733.0882352941176}

Next Jackson calculated average bill length for penguins with body mass > 3500g and bill depth >= 17.0mm:
Average Bill Length for Penguins above 3500g Body Weight and With Bill Depth Greater Than or Equal to 17.0 mm: 43.60 mm

Then Vittorio counted the penguins in the upper 25 percentile of body mass and bill length > 42 mm:
Count of Penguins in the Upper 25% of Body Mass With Bill Length > 42 mm: 90

Next Vittorio counted the total penguins with body mass > 4000g:
Total Penguins with Body Mass > 4000g: 172

Finally Vittorio counted the total Gentoo penguins with body mass > 4000g:
Total Gentoo Penguins with Body Mass > 4000g: 122

Penguins results completed.
